DOM & Templates

Vue can be used to define the goal instead of the steps (-> declarative approach)
Connect Vue to HTML via "mount": Vue the renders the real DOM based on the connected template

Data & Event Bindings
You can bind data via interpolation({{}} or the v-bind (":") directive
You ca for events via v-on("@")

Reactivity
Vue updates the real DOM for you when bound data changes
Computed properties and watches allow you to react to data changes

Styling
Dynamic CSS class and inline style bindings are supported by Vue

Vue offers mutiple special syntaxes (objected-based ,array-based,efficient bindings)
